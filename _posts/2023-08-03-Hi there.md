# Nice to meet you!

Welcome to my GameDev site!

I typically use Unreal Engine and Unity along with Visual Studio and VS Code for game programming, and Blender or Maya for assets.

The blog posts here draw from a variety of references, and might be written in English, Japanese, Chinese, or a mix of them.

I will make sure to tag them appropriately, so feel free to filter them based on your preference.

Thanks for reading, and I hope something here meets your expectations!
