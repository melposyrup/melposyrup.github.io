Hi there! You can call me kin. Beginning my journey in game programming in 2022, I've been exploring the fascinating world of coding.

- Languages and Tools
    
    I specialize in C++/C#, and I've gained hands-on experience with Unreal Engine and Unity. I've crafted a few small gamesâ€”head over to my blog for a peek!

- Interest in Graphics 
  
  I'm captivated by the magic of computer graphics, dreaming of contributing to game engine development someday.

- Favorite Game Genres
  
  Action and parkour are my jam, especially those that deliver strong punchy feedback and a sense of speed (Boost!).

- Hobbies Beyond Gaming
  
  Immersed in game streams, comics, and animations, I'm all about those visual feasts.
  
- And... Cats!
  
   Simply the best companions!
  
Dive into my blog for a glimpse into my projects, musings on game development, and my ongoing journey in this vibrant field.
